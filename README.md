# Setup-SIEM-Wazuh

 This project focuses on information security for small and medium-sized organi
zations, which often face cybersecurity threats due to limited resources and technical
 knowledge. The main objective is to simulate real-world events and address potential
 alerts detected by security tools. The report is divided into three sections: State-of
Art, Development, and Conclusion. The State-of-Art section provides an introduction
 to SIEM, Wazuh, and honeypots. Wazuh is a free and open-source threat preven
tion, detection, and response platform that safeguards workloads in various settings.
 The Development section outlines the steps involved in installing Wazuh Manager
 on a Windows machine, creating events with different criticality degrees on a Linux
 agent, and configuring advanced functionalities such as FIM on a Windows agent. The
 Conclusion section summarizes the key findings and implications of the project.
